**Abstract.**
Card game design is a well-known technique for prototyping turn-based card games in particular and interactive experiences in general.
Card game prototypes enable designers to create physical metaphors that foreground a game’s rules for freely experimenting, play testing and exploring alternative designs, at a table in a mediated setting.
We aim to empower designers with a set of digital card game tools that help automate the design process.
During this workshop, we present and discuss initial steps toward such a tool set.
We show a tool prototype [1], not as a solution for professional use, but for obtaining feedback that helps focus future R&D. Together, workshop participants will discuss and determine next steps, by relating their goals, needs and experiences.
