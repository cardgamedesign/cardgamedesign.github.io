**Project Website.**
We are opening our website on digital card game design and prototyping.

Here we share our progress for the DGA fieldlab "A Digital Prototyping Tool for Card Game Design".

We form a card game interest group that explores how to improve design processes by developing and applying tools for digital card game prototyping.
